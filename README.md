# Capstone Project: Machine Learning for Classification in Cybersecurity

This project focuses on understanding and improving key concepts in:

- **Data Preprocessing**  
- **Feature Engineering**  
- **Machine Learning Classification Techniques**  
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Macro-F1 Score, Precision, and Recall  

## Project Overview

The project involves working with two datasets: `train.csv` and `test.csv`.  
- The **training dataset** is used to build and optimize the machine learning model.  
- The **test dataset** evaluates the model's performance to ensure it generalizes effectively to unseen data.

Key evaluation metrics—**Macro-F1 Score**, **Precision**, and **Recall**—are used to assess the model's classification performance on the test data. This approach ensures the model is not only well-trained but also reliable for real-world applications, particularly in **cybersecurity** and **threat detection**.

Machine Learning Classification Techniques
Model Evaluation Metrics (Macro-F1 Score, Precision, Recall)

we have two set of data Train and Test data by train the model using the train.csv dataset and provide evaluation metrics—macro-F1 score, precision, and recall—based on the model's performance on the test.csv dataset. This ensures that the model is not only well-trained but also generalizes effectively to unseen data, making it reliable for real-world applications.
